# What is AJAX?

AJAX is a tool for web development that utilizes objects of a document formulated from HTML and/or XML. AJAX utilizes these objects to retrieve requests and responses, making them asynchronous so that the user does not need to experience the browser loading to another page once a request is made and a response is sent. Rather the browser would send the request and receive the response all while staying on the same page.

# How to Make an AJAX Call

To make an AJAX call one must specify that the AJAX call be made once the document is ready and loaded. AJAX calls are then made utilizing event handlers. An event is the action that is performed that causes a request to be sent, such as clicking on a button or submitting a form. These event handlers then are utilized by the AJAX call so that the request can be made and the request sent using AJAX.
